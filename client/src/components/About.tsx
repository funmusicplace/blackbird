          The music industry does not work for musicians or listeners and needs
          a radical re-imagination.

          Mirlo is a community of musicians, listeners, and coders who are
          daring to do just that: taking lessons learned in working in the
          solidarity economy and applying them to our process and product.

        <p>
          We are building an online audio distribution (think Bandcamp) and
          patronage (think Patreon) platform that aims to be radical,
          accessible, open source (free & libre), modular, and standards based.
